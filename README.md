# Adylic Banner Ad Test

- HTML, CSS and Vanilla JS with GSAP animation

## Styling
After initially styling with css grid, I decided to scale back to older methods, as I assumed banner ads must work the same on all browsers, including legacy browsers, and CSS grid is not supported 100%. 

## Javascript
This being the first time using GSAP, I believe that there probably is a more refined way of implementation, but this solution works, and I'm happy with it for the moment.
